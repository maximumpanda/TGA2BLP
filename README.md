# TGA2BLP
mass converter for TGA files to BLP files. converts every .TGA file in the directory and subdirectories.

firstly, I did next to no work on this. all credit goes to: 
David polomis for the TargaImage class: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/31702/NET-Targa-Image-Reader
Mundocani for creating BLP2PNG:http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info6127-BLP2PNG.html

**HOW TO USE:**

extract the exe files in TGA2BLP/bin/release anywhere (must be together).

run TGA2BLP.EXE

enter the location of your addon folder (ie: G:\games\World of Warcraft Beta\Interface\AddOns)

wait for it to convert the files. (may take a while depending on the number of files to be converted)



**this is a temporary fix** to the addon issues, please don't expect it to work forever and hopefully blizzard fixes tga loading so that this is not needed.

*if you are worried about security** you can download TGA2BLP from the link above and replace the one provided.
